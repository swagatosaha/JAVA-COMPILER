# JAVA-COMPILER
This project is a Java Code Compiler and Decompiler that allows users to compile Java source code into bytecode and decompile Java .class files back into readable Java source code. It is designed to help developers understand Java bytecode, debug compiled programs, and learn how Java compilation works internally.
